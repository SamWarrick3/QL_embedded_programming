# Disclaimer
This repository holds my course work for the Quantum Leaps Modern Embedded Systems Programming course found at https://www.state-machine.com/video-course and https://github.com/QuantumLeaps/modern-embedded-programming-course.

A large part of the code base is from the examples in this course, the qpc embedded framework provided at the same site, and the uC/OS-II embedded OS maintained by Weston Embedded Solutions at https://github.com/weston-embedded/uC-OS2.
Please refer to both sites for their licensing of thier products.

For a quick overview of the course please read the following excerpt from the course README.md file (the full file is provided on the main branch under quantum_leaps_readme.md)

## Excerpt From Modern Embedded Systems Programming Course README.md
Welcome to the ["Modern Embedded Systems Programming" video course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPW8O6W-1chwyTzI3BHwBLbGQoPFxPAPM).

In this course, you'll learn how to program embedded microcontrollers the modern way, from the basics all the way to the contemporary modern embedded programming practice.

The unique approach of this course is to step down to the machine level frequently and show you exactly what happens inside your embedded microcontroller. This deeper understanding will allow you to apply the concepts more efficiently and with greater confidence.

If you are looking for a practical, hands-on, well-structured, and in-depth course explaining the **essential concepts in embedded programming**, this *free* course is right for you.


## Relevance
The course started already in 2013, so a legitimate quesion is: "Is it still relevant?" The answer is YES, perhaps even more so than in 2013, for two main reasons:

#### Fundamental Concepts
This course focuses on the **essential and fundamental concepts** in embedded programming, which never go out of style. All presetned concepts are covered in-depth, and include:
- Binary representations (two's complement), hexadecimal notation
- Flow of control, status register, branch instructions
- Variables, arrays, and pointers
- Interfacing with the outside world (GPIO)
- Bitwise operations in C
- Functions, call stack, recursion, ARM Procedure Call Standard
- Standard integers (stdint.h) and mixing integer types
- Structures in C and CMSIS
- Startup code, vector table
- Embedded software build process (linking process)
- Interrupts and race conditions
- "superloop" architecture
- RTOS (Real-Time Operating Systems)
- Object-oriented programming (including OOP in C)
- Event-driven programming
- Active objects
- State machines, including modern hierarchical state machines
- Automatic code generation
- Software tracing
- Assertions and Design by Contract

#### ARM Cortex-M Architecture
This course focuses on the prevalent [<b>ARM Cortex-M</b>](https://www.state-machine.com/course/ARM-Cortex-M_for_beginners.pdf) architecture, which over the past decade became unquesionably dominat in the embedded MCU market. Familiarity with ARM Cortex-M is the most sought after skill that employers are looking for.
